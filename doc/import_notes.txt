sitrack tables I'm interested in:

--- sitrack_tracking
- It looks like this keeps track of somebody on the way towards starting their
- intern/stint year - paperwork, etc
internType
teamLeader
caringRegion
asgTeam
asgCountry
regionOfOrigin ?

--- sitrack_mpd
- This is MPD information. How is this data being written currently? Do I want
- to update this table remotely from my tool, so that it stays current?
coachName
coachEmail
monthlyGoal
oneTimeGoal
monthlyRaised
oneTimeRaised
totalGoal
totalRaised
percentRaised
goalYear
accountBalance

--- ministryPerson
- Here's the big data table on people's information in sitrack. I think all I
- really want is name, account no, and email, but anything else is in here.
personID
accountNo
lastName
firstName
middleName
preferredName
region
fk_ssmUserId

1 - Get a list of caringRegions(sitrack_tracking)
2 - Choose participating caringRegions
3 - Send http POST request with the list of caringRegions and years
4 - Compile data on sitrack site
	a - sitrack_tracking
		filter by caringRegion, status and internType (what do those fields do?)
		give me:
			application_id
			person_id
			status?
			internType?
			teamLeader
			caringRegion
			asgTeam
	b - sitrack_mpd
		grab by application_id and/or person_id from sitrack_tracking
		filter results further by goalYear
		give me:
			application_id
			person_id
			coachName
			monthlyGoal
			oneTimeGoal
			goalYear
	c - ministry_person (if that is where the person_id in the other tables points)
		get people who:
			are in the list of people sent in the POST request
			from sitrack_tracking
		give me:
			personID
			accountNo
			lastName
			firstName
			preferredName
	d - all together, that's:
		accountNo
		firstName
		lastName
		preferredName
		caringRegion
		goalYear
		status?
		internType?
		asgTeam
		teamLeader
		coachName
		monthlyGoal
		oneTimeGoal

5. Send as a JSON object
